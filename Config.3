.SH "NAME"
Config \- access Perl configuration information
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    use Config;
\&    if ($Config{'cc'} =~ /gcc/) {
\&        print "built by gcc\en";
\&    } 
.Ve
.Vb 1
\&    use Config qw(myconfig config_sh config_vars);
.Ve
.Vb 1
\&    print myconfig();
.Ve
.Vb 1
\&    print config_sh();
.Ve
.Vb 1
\&    config_vars(qw(osname archname));
.Ve
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The Config module contains all the information that was available to
the \f(CWConfigure\fR program at Perl build time (over 900 values).
.PP
Shell variables from the \fIconfig.sh\fR file (written by Configure) are
stored in the readonly-variable \f(CW%Config\fR, indexed by their names.
.PP
Values stored in config.sh as \*(L'undef\*(R' are returned as undefined
values.  The perl \f(CWexists\fR function can be used to check if a
named variable exists.
.Ip "myconfig()" 4
Returns a textual summary of the major perl configuration values.
See also \f(CW-V\fR in the \f(CWSwitches\fR entry in the \fIperlrun\fR manpage.
.Ip "config_sh()" 4
Returns the entire perl configuration information in the form of the
original config.sh shell variable assignment script.
.Ip "config_vars(@names)" 4
Prints to \s-1STDOUT\s0 the values of the named configuration variable. Each is
printed on a separate line in the form:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  name='value';
.Ve
Names which are unknown are output as \f(CWname='UNKNOWN';\fR.
See also \f(CW-V:name\fR in the \f(CWSwitches\fR entry in the \fIperlrun\fR manpage.
.SH "EXAMPLE"
Here's a more sophisticated example of using \f(CW%Config:\fR
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    use Config;
\&    use strict;
.Ve
.Vb 11
\&    my %sig_num;
\&    my @sig_name;
\&    unless($Config{sig_name} && $Config{sig_num}) {
\&        die "No sigs?";
\&    } else {
\&        my @names = split ' ', $Config{sig_name};
\&        @sig_num{@names} = split ' ', $Config{sig_num};
\&        foreach (@names) {
\&            $sig_name[$sig_num{$_}] ||= $_;
\&        }   
\&    }
.Ve
.Vb 4
\&    print "signal #17 = $sig_name[17]\en";
\&    if ($sig_num{ALRM}) { 
\&        print "SIGALRM is $sig_num{ALRM}\en";
\&    }   
.Ve
.SH "WARNING"
Because this information is not stored within the perl executable
itself it is possible (but unlikely) that the information does not
relate to the actual perl binary which is being used to access it.
.PP
The Config module is installed into the architecture and version
specific library directory ($Config{installarchlib}) and it checks the
perl version number when loaded.
.PP
The values stored in config.sh may be either single-quoted or
double-quoted. Double-quoted strings are handy for those cases where you
need to include escape sequences in the strings. To avoid runtime variable
interpolation, any \f(CW$\fR and \f(CW@\fR characters are replaced by \f(CW\e$\fR and
\f(CW\e@\fR, respectively. This isn't foolproof, of course, so don't embed \f(CW\e$\fR
or \f(CW\e@\fR in double-quoted strings unless you're willing to deal with the
consequences. (The slashes will end up escaped and the \f(CW$\fR or \f(CW@\fR will
trigger variable interpolation)
.SH "GLOSSARY"
Most \f(CWConfig\fR variables are determined by the \f(CWConfigure\fR script
on platforms supported by it (which is most UNIX platforms).  Some
platforms have custom-made \f(CWConfig\fR variables, and may thus not have
some of the variables described below, or may have extraneous variables
specific to that particular port.  See the port specific documentation
in such cases.
.Sh "M"
.Ip "\f(CWMcc\fR" 5
From \fILoc.U\fR:
.Sp
This variable is be used internally by Configure to determine the
full pathname (if any) of the Mcc program.  After Configure runs,
the value is reset to a plain \f(CWMcc\fR and is not useful.
.Sh "_"
.Ip "\f(CW_a\fR" 5
From \fIUnix.U\fR:
.Sp
This variable defines the extension used for ordinary libraries.
For unix, it is \fI.a\fR.  The \fI.\fR is included.  Other possible
values include \fI.lib\fR.
.Ip "\f(CW_exe\fR" 5
From \fIUnix.U\fR:
.Sp
This variable defines the extension used for executable files.
For unix it is empty.  Other possible values include \fI.exe\fR.
.Ip "\f(CW_o\fR" 5
From \fIUnix.U\fR:
.Sp
This variable defines the extension used for object files.
For unix, it is \fI.o\fR.  The \fI.\fR is included.  Other possible
values include \fI.obj\fR.
.Sh "a"
.Ip "\f(CWafs\fR" 5
From \fIafs.U\fR:
.Sp
This variable is set to \f(CWtrue\fR if \f(CWAFS\fR (Andrew File System) is used
on the system, \f(CWfalse\fR otherwise.  It is possible to override this
with a hint value or command line option, but you'd better know
what you are doing.
.Ip "\f(CWalignbytes\fR" 5
From \fIalignbytes.U\fR:
.Sp
This variable holds the number of bytes required to align a
double. Usual values are 2, 4 and 8.
.Ip "\f(CWansi2knr\fR" 5
From \fIansi2knr.U\fR:
.Sp
This variable is set if the user needs to run ansi2knr.  
Currently, this is not supported, so we just abort.
.Ip "\f(CWaphostname\fR" 5
From \fId_gethname.U\fR:
.Sp
Thie variable contains the command which can be used to compute the
host name. The command is fully qualified by its absolute path, to make
it safe when used by a process with super-user privileges.
.Ip "\f(CWapiversion\fR" 5
From \fIpatchlevel.U\fR:
.Sp
This is a number which identifies the lowest version of perl
to have an \f(CWAPI\fR (for \f(CWXS\fR extensions) compatible with the present
version.  For example, for 5.005_01, the apiversion should be
5.005, since 5.005_01 should be binary compatible with 5.005.
This should probably be incremented manually somehow, perhaps
from \fIpatchlevel.h\fR.  For now, we'll guess maintenance subversions
will retain binary compatibility.
.Ip "\f(CWar\fR" 5
From \fILoc.U\fR:
.Sp
This variable is be used internally by Configure to determine the
full pathname (if any) of the ar program.  After Configure runs,
the value is reset to a plain \f(CWar\fR and is not useful.
.Ip "\f(CWarchlib\fR" 5
From \fIarchlib.U\fR:
.Sp
This variable holds the name of the directory in which the user wants
to put architecture-dependent public library files for \f(CW$package\fR.
It is most often a local directory such as \fI/usr/local/lib\fR.
Programs using this variable must be prepared to deal
with filename expansion.
.Ip "\f(CWarchlibexp\fR" 5
From \fIarchlib.U\fR:
.Sp
This variable is the same as the archlib variable, but is
filename expanded at configuration time, for convenient use.
.Ip "\f(CWarchname\fR" 5
From \fIarchname.U\fR:
.Sp
This variable is a short name to characterize the current
architecture.  It is used mainly to construct the default archlib.
.Ip "\f(CWarchobjs\fR" 5
From \fIUnix.U\fR:
.Sp
This variable defines any additional objects that must be linked
in with the program on this architecture.  On unix, it is usually
empty.  It is typically used to include emulations of unix calls
or other facilities.  For perl on \fI\s-1OS/2\s0\fR, for example, this would
include \fIos2/os2.obj\fR.
.Ip "\f(CWawk\fR" 5
From \fILoc.U\fR:
.Sp
This variable is be used internally by Configure to determine the
full pathname (if any) of the awk program.  After Configure runs,

The value is a plain \*(L'\*(R' and is not useful.
.Ip "\f(CWbin\fR" 5
From \fIbin.U\fR:
.Sp
This variable holds the name of the directory in which the user wants
to put publicly executable images for the package in question.  It
is most often a local directory such as \fI/usr/local/bin\fR. Programs using
this variable must be prepared to deal with \fI~name\fR substitution.
.Ip "\f(CWbinexp\fR" 5
From \fIbin.U\fR:
.Sp
This is the same as the bin variable, but is filename expanded at
configuration time, for use in your makefiles.
.Ip "\f(CWbison\fR" 5
From \fILoc.U\fR:
.Sp
This variable is defined but not used by Configure.
The value is a plain \*(L'\*(R' and is not useful.
.Ip "\f(CWbyacc\fR" 5
From \fILoc.U\fR:
.Sp
This variable is be used internally by Configure to determine the
full pathname (if any) of the byacc program.  After Configure runs,
the value is reset to a plain \f(CWbyacc\fR and is not useful.
.Ip "\f(CWbyteorder\fR" 5
From \fIbyteorder.U\fR:
.Sp
This variable holds the byte order. In the following, larger digits
indicate more significance.  The variable byteorder is either 4321
on a big-endian machine, or 1234 on a little-endian, or 87654321
on a Cray ... or 3412 with weird order !
.Sh "c"
.Ip "\f(CWc\fR" 5
From \fIn.U\fR:
.Sp
This variable contains the \ec string if that is what causes the echo
command to suppress newline.  Otherwise it is null.  Correct usage is
.Sp
.Vb 1

D:\fI/bin/sh.exe\fR.
This unit comes before \fIOptions.U\fR, so you can't set sh with a \f(CW-D\fR
option, though you can override this (and startsh)

shared \fIlibperl.so\fR.  The makefile can use this with something like
.Sp
.Vb 1

.Sp
This variable contains the value to be passed to the \fItr\fR\|(1)
command to transliterate a newline.  Typical values are
\f(CW\e012\fR and \f(CW\en\fR.  This is needed for \f(CWEBCDIC\fR systems where
newline is not necessarily \f(CW\e012\fR.
.Ip "\f(CWtroff\fR" 5
From \fILoc.U\fR:
.Sp
This variable is defined but not used by Configure.

.Ip "\f(CWusedl\fR" 5
From \fIdlsrc.U\fR:
.Sp
This variable indicates if the the system supports dynamic
loading of some sort.  See also dlsrc and dlobj.
.Ip "\f(CWusemymalloc\fR" 5
From \fImallocsrc.U\fR:
.Sp
This variable contains y if the malloc that comes with this package
is desired over the system's version of malloc.  People often include
special versions of malloc for effiency, but such versions are often
less portable.  See also mallocsrc and mallocobj.
If this is \f(CWy\fR, then \-lmalloc is removed from \f(CW$libs\fR.
.Ip "\f(CWusenm\fR" 5
From \fIusenm.U\fR:
.Sp
This variable contains \f(CWtrue\fR or \f(CWfalse\fR depending whether the
nm extraction is wanted or not.
.Ip "\f(CWuseopcode\fR" 5
From \fIExtensions.U\fR:
.Sp

on a particular system.
.Ip "\f(CWusesfio\fR" 5
From \fId_sfio.U\fR:
.Sp
This variable is set to true when the user agrees to use sfio.
It is set to false when sfio is not available or when the user
explicitely requests not to use sfio.  It is here primarily so
that command-line settings can override the auto-detection of
d_sfio without running into a \*(L"\s-1WHOA\s0 \s-1THERE\s0\*(R".
.Ip "\f(CWuseshrplib\fR" 5
From \fIlibperl.U\fR:
.Sp
This variable is set to \f(CWyes\fR if the user wishes
