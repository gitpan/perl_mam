.SH "NAME"
MIME\-tools \- modules for parsing (and creating!) MIME entities
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
Here's some pretty basic code for \fBparsing a MIME message,\fR and outputting
its decoded components to a given directory:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    use MIME::Parser;
.Ve
.Vb 3
\&    ### Create parser, and set some parsing options:
\&    my $parser = new MIME::Parser;
\&    $parser->output_under("$ENV{HOME}/mimemail");
.Ve
.Vb 2
\&    ### Parse input:
\&    $entity = $parser->parse(\e*STDIN) or die "parse failed\en";
.Ve
.Vb 2
\&    ### Take a look at the top-level entity (and any parts it has):
\&    $entity->dump_skeleton;
.Ve
Here's some code which \fBcomposes and sends a MIME message\fR containing
three parts: a text file, an attached GIF, and some more text:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    use MIME::Entity;
.Ve
.Vb 5
\&    ### Create the top-level, and set up the mail headers:
\&    $top = MIME::Entity->build(Type    =>"multipart/mixed",
\&                               From    => "me\e@myhost.com",
\&                               To      => "you\e@yourhost.com",
\&                               Subject => "Hello, nurse!");
.Ve
.Vb 2
\&    ### Part #1: a simple text document:
\&    $top->attach(Path=>"./testin/short.txt");
.Ve
.Vb 4
\&    ### Part #2: a GIF file:
\&    $top->attach(Path        => "./docs/mime-sm.gif",
\&                 Type        => "image/gif",
\&                 Encoding    => "base64");
.Ve
.Vb 2
\&    ### Part #3: some literal text:
\&    $top->attach(Data=>$message);
.Ve
.Vb 4
\&    ### Send it:
\&    open MAIL, "| /usr/lib/sendmail -t -oi -oem" or die "open: $!";
\&    $top->print(\e*MAIL);
\&    close MAIL;
.Ve
For more examples, look at the scripts in the \fBexamples\fR directory
of the MIME\-tools distribution.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
MIME\-tools is a collection of Perl5 MIME:: modules for parsing, decoding,
\fIand generating\fR single- or multipart (even nested multipart) MIME
messages.  (Yes, kids, that means you can send messages with attached
GIF files).
.SH "REQUIREMENTS"
You will need the following installed on your system:
.PP
.Vb 8
\&        File::Path
\&        File::Spec
\&        IPC::Open2              (optional)
\&        IO::Scalar, ...         from the IO-stringy distribution
\&        MIME::Base64
\&        MIME::QuotedPrint
\&        Net::SMTP
\&        Mail::Internet, ...     from the MailTools distribution.
.Ve
See the Makefile.PL in your distribution for the most-comprehensive
list of prerequisite modules and their version numbers.
.SH "A QUICK TOUR"
.Sh "Overview of the classes"
Here are the classes you'll generally be dealing with directly:
.PP
.Vb 28
\&    (START HERE)            results() .-----------------.
\&          \e                 .-------->| MIME::          |

\&           | MIME::    |--'           `-----------------'
\&           | Parser    |--.           .-----------------.
\&           `-----------'   \e filer()  | MIME::          |
\&              | parse()     `-------->| Parser::Filer   |
\&              | gives you             `-----------------'
\&              | a...                                  | output_path()

\&              |    returns...   | MIME:: | get()      |
\&              V       .-------->| Head   | etc...     |
\&           .--------./          `--------'            |
\&     .---> | MIME:: |                                 |
\&     `-----| Entity |           .--------.            |
\&   parts() `--------'\e          | MIME:: |           /
\&   returns            `-------->| Body   |<---------'
\&   sub-entities    bodyhandle() `--------'
\&   (if any)        returns...       | open()
\&                                    | returns...
\&                                    |
\&                                    V
\&                                .--------. read()
\&                                | IO::   | getline()
\&                                | Handle | print()
\&                                `--------' etc...
.Ve
To illustrate, parsing works this way:
.Ip "\(bu" 4
\fBThe \*(L"parser\*(R" parses the \s-1MIME\s0 stream.\fR
A parser is an instance of \f(CWMIME::Parser\fR.
You hand it an input stream (like a filehandle) to parse a message from:
if the parse is successful, the result is an \*(L"entity\*(R".
.Ip "\(bu" 4
\fBA parsed message is represented by an \*(L"entity\*(R".\fR
An entity is an instance of \f(CWMIME::Entity\fR (a subclass of \f(CWMail::Internet\fR).
If the message had \*(L"parts\*(R" (e.g., attachments), then those parts
are \*(L"entities\*(R" as well, contained inside the top-level entity.
Each entity has a \*(L"head\*(R" and a \*(L"body\*(R".
.Ip "\(bu" 4
\fBThe entity's \*(L"head\*(R" contains information about the message.\fR
A \*(L"head\*(R" is an instance of \f(CWMIME::Head\fR (a subclass of \f(CWMail::Header\fR).
It contains information from the message header: content type,
sender, subject line, etc.
.Ip "\(bu" 4
\fBThe entity's \*(L"body\*(R" knows where the message data is.\fR
You can ask to \*(L"open\*(R" this data source for \fIreading\fR or \fIwriting\fR,
and you will get back an \*(L"I/O handle\*(R".
.Ip "\(bu" 4
\fBYou can open() a \*(L"body\*(R" and get an \*(L"I/O handle\*(R" to read/write message data.\fR
This handle is an object that is basically like an \s-1IO::\s0Handle or
a FileHandle... it can be any class, so long as it supports a small,
standard set of methods for reading from or writing to the underlying
data source.
.PP
A typical multipart message containing two parts -- a textual greeting
and an \*(L"attached\*(R" \s-1GIF\s0 file -- would be a tree of \s-1MIME::\s0Entity objects,
each of which would have its own \s-1MIME::\s0Head.  Like this:
.PP
.Vb 16
\&    .--------.
\&    | MIME:: | Content-type: multipart/mixed
\&    | Entity | Subject: Happy Samhaine!
\&    `--------'
\&         |
\&         `----.
\&        parts |
\&              |   .--------.
\&              |---| MIME:: | Content-type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
\&              |   | Entity | Content-transfer-encoding: 7bit
\&              |   `--------'
\&              |   .--------.
\&              |---| MIME:: | Content-type: image/gif
\&                  | Entity | Content-transfer-encoding: base64
\&                  `--------' Content-disposition: inline;
\&                               filename="hs.gif"
.Ve
.Sh "Parsing messages"
You usually start by creating an instance of \fB\s-1MIME::\s0Parser\fR
and setting up certain parsing parameters: what directory to save
extracted files to, how to name the files, etc.
.PP
You then give that instance a readable filehandle on which waits a
\s-1MIME\s0 message.  If all goes well, you will get back a \fB\s-1MIME::\s0Entity\fR
object (a subclass of \fBMail::Internet\fR), which consists of...
.Ip "\(bu" 4
A \fB\s-1MIME::\s0Head\fR (a subclass of \fBMail::Header\fR) which holds the \s-1MIME\s0
header data.
.Ip "\(bu" 4
A \fB\s-1MIME::\s0Body\fR, which is a object that knows where the body data is.
You ask this object to \*(L"open\*(R" itself for reading, and it
will hand you back an \*(L"I/O handle\*(R" for reading the data: this is
a FileHandle-like object, and could be of any class, so long as it
conforms to a subset of the \fB\s-1IO::\s0Handle\fR interface.
.PP
If the original message was a multipart document, the \s-1MIME::\s0Entity
object will have a non-empty list of \*(L"parts\*(R", each of which is in
turn a \s-1MIME::\s0Entity (which might also be a multipart entity, etc,
etc...).
.PP
Internally, the parser (in \s-1MIME::\s0Parser) asks for instances
of \fB\s-1MIME::\s0Decoder\fR whenever it needs to decode an encoded file.
\s-1MIME::\s0Decoder has a mapping from supported encodings (e.g., \*(L'base64')
to classes whose instances can decode them.  You can add to this mapping
to try out new/experiment encodings.  You can also use
\s-1MIME::\s0Decoder by itself.
.Sh "Composing messages"
All message composition is done via the \fB\s-1MIME::\s0Entity\fR class.
For single-part messages, you can use the \fB\s-1MIME::\s0Entity/build\fR
constructor to create \s-1MIME\s0 entities very easily.
.PP
For multipart messages, you can start by creating a top-level
\f(CWmultipart\fR entity with \fB\s-1MIME::\s0Entity::build()\fR, and then use
the similar \fB\s-1MIME::\s0Entity::attach()\fR method to attach parts to
that message.  \fIPlease note:\fR what most people think of as
\*(L"a text message with an attached \s-1GIF\s0 file\*(R" is \fIreally\fR a multipart
message with 2 parts: the first being the text message, and the
second being the \s-1GIF\s0 file.
.PP
When building \s-1MIME\s0 a entity, you'll have to provide two very important
pieces of information: the \fIcontent type\fR and the
\fIcontent transfer encoding\fR.  The type is usually easy, as it is directly
determined by the file format; e.g., an \s-1HTML\s0 file is \f(CWtext/html\fR.
The encoding, however, is trickier... for example, some \s-1HTML\s0 files are
\f(CW7bit\fR\-compliant, but others might have very long lines and would need to be
sent \f(CWquoted-printable\fR for reliability.
.PP
See the section on encoding/decoding for more details, as well as
the section on \fIA \s-1MIME\s0 \s-1PRIMER\s0\fR.
.Sh "Sending email"
Since \s-1MIME::\s0Entity inherits directly from Mail::Internet,
you can use the normal Mail::Internet mechanisms to send
email.  For example,
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    $entity->smtpsend;
.Ve
.Sh "Encoding/decoding support"
The \fB\s-1MIME::\s0Decoder\fR class can be used to \fIencode\fR as well; this is done
when printing \s-1MIME\s0 entities.  All the standard encodings are supported
(see the section on \fIA \s-1MIME\s0 \s-1PRIMER\s0\fR for details):
.PP
.Vb 7
\&    Encoding:        | Normally used when message contents are:
\&    -------------------------------------------------------------------
\&    7bit             | 7-bit data with under 1000 chars/line, or multipart.
\&    8bit             | 8-bit data with under 1000 chars/line.
\&    binary           | 8-bit data with some long lines (or no line breaks).
\&    quoted-printable | Text files with some 8-bit chars (e.g., Latin-1 text).
\&    base64           | Binary files.
.Ve
Which encoding you choose for a given document depends largely on
(1) what you know about the document's contents (text vs binary), and
(2) whether you need the resulting message to have a reliable encoding
for 7-bit Internet email transport.
.PP
In general, only \f(CWquoted-printable\fR and \f(CWbase64\fR guarantee reliable
transport of all data; the other three \*(L"no-encoding\*(R" encodings simply
pass the data through, and are only reliable if that data is 7bit \s-1ASCII\s0
with under 1000 characters per line, and has no conflicts with the
multipart boundaries.
.PP
I've considered making it so that the content-type and encoding
can be automatically inferred from the file's path, but that seems
to be asking for trouble... or at least, for Mail::Cap...
.Sh "Message-logging"
\s-1MIME\s0\-tools is a large and complex toolkit which tries to deal with 
a wide variety of external input.  It's sometimes helpful to see
what's really going on behind the scenes.
There are several kinds of messages logged by the toolkit itself:
.Ip "Debug messages" 4
These are printed directly to the \s-1STDERR\s0, with a prefix of
\f(CW"MIME-tools: debug"\fR.  
.Sp
Debug message are only logged if you have turned
the \f(CWdebugging\fR entry elsewhere in this documenton in the \s-1MIME::\s0Tools configuration.
.Ip "Warning messages" 4
These are logged by the standard Perl \fIwarn()\fR mechanism
to indicate an unusual situation.  
They all have a prefix of \f(CW"MIME-tools: warning"\fR.
.Sp
Warning messages are only logged if \f(CW$^W\fR is set true 
and \s-1MIME::\s0Tools is not configured to be the \f(CWquiet\fR entry elsewhere in this document.
.Ip "Error messages" 4
These are logged by the standard Perl \fIwarn()\fR mechanism
to indicate that something actually failed.
They all have a prefix of \f(CW"MIME-tools: error"\fR.
.Sp
Error messages are only logged if \f(CW$^W\fR is set true 
and \s-1MIME::\s0Tools is not configured to be the \f(CWquiet\fR entry elsewhere in this document.
.Ip "Usage messages" 4
Unlike \*(L"typical\*(R" warnings above, which warn about problems processing
data, usage-warnings are for alerting developers of deprecated methods 
and suspicious invocations.  
.Sp
Usage messages are currently only logged if \f(CW$^W\fR is set true 
and \s-1MIME::\s0Tools is not configured to be the \f(CWquiet\fR entry elsewhere in this document.
.PP
When a \s-1MIME::\s0Parser (or one of its internal helper classes)
wants to report a message, it generally does so by recording 
the message to the \fB\s-1MIME::\s0Parser::Results\fR object
immediately before invoking the appropriate function above.
That means each parsing run has its own trace-log which 
can be examined for problems.
.Sh "Configuring the toolkit"
If you want to tweak the way this toolkit works (for example, to
turn on debugging), use the routines in the \fB\s-1MIME::\s0Tools\fR module.
.Ip "debugging" 5
Turn debugging on or off.  
Default is false (off).
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&     MIME::Tools->debugging(1);
.Ve
.Ip "quiet" 5
Turn the reporting of warning/error messages on or off.  
Default is true, meaning that these message are silenced.
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&     MIME::Tools->quiet(1);
.Ve
.Ip "version" 5
Return the toolkit version.
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&     print MIME::Tools->version, "\en";
.Ve
.SH "THINGS YOU SHOULD DO"
.Sh "Take a look at the examples"
The \s-1MIME\s0\-Tools distribution comes with an \*(L"examples\*(R" directory.
The scripts in there are basically just tossed-together, but
they'll give you some ideas of how to use the parser.
.Sh "Run with warnings enabled"
\fIAlways\fR run your Perl script with \f(CW-w\fR.
If you see a warning about a deprecated method, change your 
code \s-1ASAP\s0.  This will ease upgrades tremendously.
.Sh "Avoid non-standard encodings"
Don't try to \s-1MIME\s0\-encode using the non-standard \s-1MIME\s0 encodings.
It's just not a good practice if you want people to be able to
read your messages.
.Sh "Plan for thrown exceptions"
For example, if your mail-handling code absolutely must not die,
then perform mail parsing like this:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    $entity = eval { $parser->parse(\e*INPUT) };
.Ve
Parsing is a complex process, and some components may throw exceptions
if seriously-bad things happen.  Since \*(L"seriously-bad\*(R" is in the
eye of the beholder, you're better off \fIcatching\fR possible exceptions
instead of asking me to propagate \f(CWundef\fR up the stack.  Use of exceptions in
reusable modules is one of those religious issues we're never all
going to agree upon; thankfully, that's what \f(CWeval{}\fR is good for.
.Sh "Check the parser results for warnings/errors"
As of 5.3xx, the parser tries extremely hard to give you a
\s-1MIME::\s0Entity.  If there were any problems, it logs warnings/errors
to the underlying \*(L"results\*(R" object (see the \fI\s-1MIME::\s0Parser::Results\fR manpage).
Look at that object after each parse.
Print out the warnings and errors, \fIespecially\fR if messages don't
parse the way you thought they would.
.Sh "Don't plan on printing exactly what you parsed!"
\fIParsing is a (slightly) lossy operation.\fR
Because of things like ambiguities in base64-encoding, the following 
is \fInot\fR going to spit out its input unchanged in all cases:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    $entity = $parser->parse(\e*STDIN);
\&    $entity->print(\e*STDOUT);
.Ve
If you're using \s-1MIME::\s0Tools to process email, remember to save
the data you parse if you want to send it on unchanged.  
This is vital for things like \s-1PGP\s0\-signed email.
.Sh "Understand how international characters are represented"
The \s-1MIME\s0 standard allows for text strings in headers to contain 
characters from any character set, by using special sequences
which look like this:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    =?ISO-8859-1?Q?Keld_J=F8rn_Simonsen?=
.Ve
To be consistent with the existing Mail::Field classes, \s-1MIME::\s0Tools
does \fInot\fR automatically unencode these strings, since doing so would
lose the character-set information and interfere with the parsing 
of fields (see the \f(CWdecode_headers\fR entry in the \fI\s-1MIME::\s0Parser\fR manpage for a full explanation).
That means you should be prepared to deal with these encoded strings.
.PP
The most common question then is, \fBhow do I decode these encoded strings?\fR
The answer depends on what you want to decode them \fIto\fR:
\s-1ASCII\s0, Latin1, \s-1UTF\s0\-8, etc.  Be aware that your \*(L"target\*(R" representation
may not support all possible character sets you might encounter; 
for example, Latin1 (\s-1ISO\s0\-8859-1) has no way of representing Big5 
(Chinese) characters.  A common practice is to represent \*(L"untranslateable\*(R"
characters as \*(L"?"s, or to ignore them completely.
.PP
To unencode the strings into some of the more-popular Western byte 
representations (e.g., Latin1, Latin2, etc.), you can use the decoders 
in \s-1MIME::\s0WordDecoder (see the \fI\s-1MIME::\s0WordDecoder\fR manpage).  
The simplest way is by using \f(CWunmime()\fR, a function wrapped
around your \*(L"default\*(R" decoder, as follows:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    use MIME::WordDecoder;    
\&    ...
\&    $subject = unmime $entity->head->get('subject');
.Ve
One place this \fIis\fR done automatically is in extracting the recommended
filename for a part while parsing.  That's why you should start by
setting up the best \*(L"default\*(R" decoder if the default target of Latin1
isn't to your liking.
.SH "THINGS I DO THAT YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT"
.Sh "Fuzzing of \s-1CRLF\s0 and newline on input"
\s-1RFC\s0\-1521 dictates that \s-1MIME\s0 streams have lines terminated by \s-1CRLF\s0
(\f(CW"\er\en"\fR).  However, it is extremely likely that folks will want to
parse \s-1MIME\s0 streams where each line ends in the local newline
character \f(CW"\en"\fR instead.
.PP
An attempt has been made to allow the parser to handle both \s-1CRLF\s0
and newline-terminated input.
.Sh "Fuzzing of \s-1CRLF\s0 and newline when decoding"
The \f(CW"7bit"\fR and \f(CW"8bit"\fR decoders will decode both
a \f(CW"\en"\fR and a \f(CW"\er\en"\fR end-of-line sequence into a \f(CW"\en"\fR.
.PP
The \f(CW"binary"\fR decoder (default if no encoding specified)
still outputs stuff verbatim... so a \s-1MIME\s0 message with CRLFs
and no explicit encoding will be output as a text file
that, on many systems, will have an annoying ^M at the end of
each line... \fIbut this is as it should be\fR.
.Sh "Fuzzing of \s-1CRLF\s0 and newline when encoding/composing"
All encoders currently output the end-of-line sequence as a \f(CW"\en"\fR,
with the assumption that the local mail agent will perform
the conversion from newline to \s-1CRLF\s0 when sending the mail.
However, there probably should be an option to output \s-1CRLF\s0 as per \s-1RFC\s0\-1521.
.Sh "Inability to handle multipart boundaries with embedded newlines"
Let's get something straight: this is an evil, \s-1EVIL\s0 practice.
If your mailer creates multipart boundary strings that contain
newlines, give it two weeks notice and find another one.  If your
mail robot receives \s-1MIME\s0 mail like this, regard it as syntactically
incorrect, which it is.
.Sh "Ignoring non-header headers"
People like to hand the parser raw messages straight from 
\s-1POP3\s0 or from a mailbox.  There is often predictable non-header
information in front of the real headers; e.g., the initial
\*(L"From\*(R" line in the following message:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    From - Wed Mar 22 02:13:18 2000
\&    Return-Path: <eryq@zeegee.com>
\&    Subject: Hello
.Ve
The parser simply ignores such stuff quietly.  Perhaps it
shouldn't, but most people seem to want that behavior.
.Sh "Fuzzing of empty multipart preambles"
Please note that there is currently an ambiguity in the way
preambles are parsed in.  The following message fragments \fIboth\fR
are regarded as having an empty preamble (where \f(CW\en\fR indicates a 
newline character):
.PP
.Vb 12
\&     Content-type: multipart/mixed; boundary="xyz"\en
\&     Subject: This message (#1) has an empty preamble\en
\&     \en      
\&     --xyz\en
\&     ...
\&      
\&     Content-type: multipart/mixed; boundary="xyz"\en
\&     Subject: This message (#2) also has an empty preamble\en
\&     \en      
\&     \en
\&     --xyz\en
\&     ...
.Ve
In both cases, the \fIfirst\fR completely-empty line (after the \*(L"Subject")
marks the end of the header.  
.PP
But we should clearly ignore the \fIsecond\fR empty line in message #2,
since it fills the role of \fI"the newline which is only there to make
sure that the boundary is at the beginning of a line\*(R"\fR.  
Such newlines are \fInever\fR part of the content preceding the boundary; 
thus, there is no preamble \*(L"content\*(R" in message #2.
.PP
However, it seems clear that message #1 \fIalso\fR has no preamble
\*(L"content\*(R", and is in fact merely a compact representation of an
empty preamble.
.Sh "Use of a temp file during parsing "
\fIWhy not do everything in core?\fR
Although the amount of core available on even a modest home
system continues to grow, the size of attachments continues
to grow with it.  I wanted to make sure that even users with small
systems could deal with decoding multi-megabyte sounds and movie files.
That means not being core-bound.
.PP
As of the released 5.3xx, \s-1MIME::\s0Parser gets by with only
one temp file open per parser.  This temp file provides
a sort of infinite scratch space for dealing with the current
message part.  It's fast and lightweight, but you should know
about it anyway.
.Sh "Why do I assume that \s-1MIME\s0 objects are email objects?"
Achim Bohnet once pointed out that \s-1MIME\s0 headers do nothing more than
store a collection of attributes, and thus could be represented as
objects which don't inherit from Mail::Header.
.PP
I agree in principle, but \s-1RFC\s0\-1521 says otherwise.
\s-1RFC\s0\-1521 [\s-1MIME\s0] headers are a syntactic subset of \s-1RFC\s0\-822 [email] headers.
Perhaps a better name for these modules would have been \s-1RFC1521\s0::
instead of \s-1MIME\s0::, but we're a little beyond that stage now.
.PP
When I originally wrote these modules for the \s-1CPAN\s0, I agonized for a long
time about whether or not they really should subclass from \fBMail::Internet\fR
(then at version 1.17).  Thanks to Graham Barr, who graciously evolved
MailTools 1.06 to be more \s-1MIME\s0\-friendly, unification was achieved
at \s-1MIME\s0\-tools release 2.0.
The benefits in reuse alone have been substantial.
.SH "A MIME PRIMER"
So you need to parse (or create) MIME, but you're not quite up on
the specifics?  No problem...
.Sh "Glossary"
Here are some definitions adapted from \s-1RFC\s0\-1521 explaining the terminology
we use; each is accompanied by the equivalent in \s-1MIME\s0:: module terms...
.Ip "attachment" 4
An \*(L"attachment\*(R" is common slang for any part of a multipart message --
except, perhaps, for the first part, which normally carries a user
message describing the attachments that follow (e.g.: \*(L"Hey dude, here's
that \s-1GIF\s0 file I promised you.").
.Sp
In our system, an attachment is just a \fB\s-1MIME::\s0Entity\fR under the
top-level entity, probably one of its parts.
.Ip "body" 4
The \*(L"body\*(R" of an entity is that portion of the entity
which follows the header and which contains the real message
content.  For example, if your \s-1MIME\s0 message has a \s-1GIF\s0 file attachment,
then the body of that attachment is the base64-encoded \s-1GIF\s0 file itself.
.Sp
A body is represented by an instance of \fB\s-1MIME::\s0Body\fR.  You get the
body of an entity by sending it a bodyhandle()
message.
.Ip "body part" 4
One of the parts of the body of a multipart \fB/entity\fR.
A body part has a \fB/header\fR and a \fB/body\fR, so it makes sense to
speak about the body of a body part.
.Sp
Since a body part is just a kind of entity, it's represented by
an instance of \fB\s-1MIME::\s0Entity\fR.
.Ip "entity" 4
An \*(L"entity\*(R" means either a \fB/message\fR or a \fB/body part\fR.
All entities have a \fB/header\fR and a \fB/body\fR.
.Sp
An entity is represented by an instance of \fB\s-1MIME::\s0Entity\fR.
There are instance methods for recovering the
header (a \fB\s-1MIME::\s0Head\fR) and the
body (a \fB\s-1MIME::\s0Body\fR).
.Ip "header" 4
This is the top portion of the \s-1MIME\s0 message, which contains the
\*(L"Content-type\*(R", \*(L"Content-transfer-encoding\*(R", etc.  Every \s-1MIME\s0 entity has
a header, represented by an instance of \fB\s-1MIME::\s0Head\fR.  You get the
header of an entity by sending it a \fIhead()\fR message.
.Ip "message" 4
A \*(L"message\*(R" generally means the complete (or \*(L"top-level") message being
transferred on a network.
.Sp
There currently is no explicit package for \*(L"messages\*(R"; under \s-1MIME\s0::,
messages are streams of data which may be read in from files or
filehandles.  You can think of the \fB\s-1MIME::\s0Entity\fR returned by the
\fB\s-1MIME::\s0Parser\fR as representing the full message.
.Sh "Content types"
This indicates what kind of data is in the \s-1MIME\s0 message, usually
as \fImajortype/minortype\fR.  The standard major types are shown below.
A more-comprehensive listing may be found in \s-1RFC\s0\-2046.
.Ip "application" 4
Data which does not fit in any of the other categories, particularly
data to be processed by some type of application program.
\f(CWapplication/octet-stream\fR, \f(CWapplication/gzip\fR, \f(CWapplication/postscript\fR...
.Ip "audio" 4
Audio data.
\f(CWaudio/basic\fR...
.Ip "image" 4
Graphics data.
\f(CWimage/gif\fR, \f(CWimage/jpeg\fR...
.Ip "message" 4
A message, usually another mail or \s-1MIME\s0 message.
\f(CWmessage/rfc822\fR...
.Ip "multipart" 4
A message containing other messages.
\f(CWmultipart/mixed\fR, \f(CWmultipart/alternative\fR...
.Ip "text" 4
Textual data, meant for humans to read.
\f(CWtext/plain\fR, \f(CWtext/html\fR...
.Ip "video" 4
Video or video+audio data.
\f(CWvideo/mpeg\fR...
.Sh "Content transfer encodings"
This is how the message body is packaged up for safe transit.
There are the 5 major \s-1MIME\s0 encodings.
A more-comprehensive listing may be found in \s-1RFC\s0\-2045.
.Ip "7bit" 4
No encoding is done at all.  This label simply asserts that no
8-bit characters are present, and that lines do not exceed 1000 characters
in length (including the \s-1CRLF\s0).
.Ip "8bit" 4
No encoding is done at all.  This label simply asserts that the message
might contain 8-bit characters, and that lines do not exceed 1000 characters
in length (including the \s-1CRLF\s0).
.Ip "binary" 4
No encoding is done at all.  This label simply asserts that the message
might contain 8-bit characters, and that lines may exceed 1000 characters
in length.  Such messages are the \fIleast\fR likely to get through mail
gateways.
.Ip "base64" 4
A standard encoding, which maps arbitrary binary data to the 7bit domain.
Like \*(L"uuencode\*(R", but very well-defined.  This is how you should send
essentially binary information (tar files, GIFs, JPEGs, etc.).
.Ip "quoted-printable" 4
A standard encoding, which maps arbitrary line-oriented data to the
7bit domain.  Useful for encoding messages which are textual in
nature, yet which contain non-\s-1ASCII\s0 characters (e.g., Latin-1,
Latin-2, or any other 8-bit alphabet).

big block of lines) would work with \s-1MIME::\s0Decoder::QuotedPrint, but I
don't have the time or resources to check that right now (tested

\s-1MIME::\s0Entity's \f(CWbuild()\fR method now warns you if you give it an illegal
boundary string, and substitutes one of its own.
.Sp
\s-1MIME::\s0Entity's \f(CWbuild()\fR method now generates safer, fully-\s-1RFC\s0\-1521-compliant
boundary strings.
.Sp
Bug in \s-1MIME::\s0Decoder's \f(CWinstall()\fR method was fixed.
\fIThanks to Rolf Nelson and Nickolay Saukh for finding this.\fR
.Sp
Changed FileHandle::new_tmpfile to FileHandle->new_tmpfile, so some
Perl installations will be happier.
\fIThanks to Larry W. Virden for finding this bug.\fR
.Sp
Gave \f(CW=over\fR an arg of 4 in all PODs.
\fIThanks to Larry W. Virden for pointing out the problems of bare =over's\fR
.Ip "Version 2.04   " 4
\fBA bug in \s-1MIME::\s0Entity's output method was corrected.\fR
\s-1MIME::\s0Entity::print now outputs everything to the desired filehandle
explicitly.
\fIThanks to Jake Morrison for pointing out the incompatibility
with Mail::Header.\fR
.Ip "Version 2.03   " 4
\fBFixed bug in autogenerated filenames\fR resulting from transposed \*(L"if\*(R"
statement in \s-1MIME::\s0Parser, removing spurious printing of header as well.
(Annoyingly, this bug is invisible if debugging is turned on!)
\fIThanks to Andreas Koenig for bringing this to my attention.\fR
.Sp
Fixed bug in \fI\s-1MIME::\s0Entity::body()\fR where it was using the bodyhandle
completely incorrectly.
\fIThanks to Joel Noble for bringing this to my attention.\fR
.Sp
Fixed \s-1MIME::\s0Head::\s-1VERSION\s0 so \s-1CPAN\s0:: is happier.

.Sp
Fixed undefined-variable warnings when dumping skeleton
(happened when there was no Subject: line)
\fIThanks to Joel Noble for bringing this to my attention.\fR
.Ip "Version 2.02   " 4
\fBStupid, stupid bugs in both \s-1BASE64\s0 encoding and decoding were fixed.\fR
\fIThanks to Phil Abercrombie for locating them.\fR
.Ip "Version 2.01   " 4
\fBModules now inherit from the new Mail:: modules!\fR
This means big changes in behavior.
.Sp
\fB\s-1MIME::\s0Parser can now store message data in-core.\fR
There were a \fIlot\fR of requests for this feature.
.Sp
\fB\s-1MIME::\s0Entity can now compose messages.\fR
There were a \fIlot\fR of requests for this feature.
.Sp
Added option to parse \f(CW"message/rfc822"\fR as a pseduo-multipart document.
\fIThanks to Andreas Koenig for suggesting this.\fR
.Ip "Version 1.13   " 4
\s-1MIME::\s0Head now no longer requires space after \*(L":\*(R", although
either a space or a tab after the \*(L":\*(R" will be swallowed
if there.
\fIThanks to Igor Starovoitov for pointing out this shortcoming.\fR
.Ip "Version 1.12   " 4
Fixed bugs in parser where \s-1CRLF\s0\-terminated lines were
blowing out the handling of preambles/epilogues.
\fIThanks to Russell Sutherland for reporting this bug.\fR
.Sp
Fixed idiotic \fIis_multipart()\fR bug.
\fIThanks to Andreas Koenig for noticing it.\fR
.Sp
Added untested \fIbinmode()\fR calls to parser for \s-1DOS\s0, etc.
systems.  No idea if this will work...
.Sp
Reorganized the \fIoutput_path()\fR methods to allow easy use
of inheritance, as per Achim Bohnet's suggestion.
.Sp
Changed \s-1MIME::\s0Head to report mime_type more accurately.
.Sp
\s-1POSIX\s0 module no longer loaded by Parser if perl >= 5.002.
Hey, 5.001'ers: let me know if this breaks stuff, okay?
.Sp
Added unsupported ./examples directory.
.Ip "Version 1.11   " 4
Converted over to using Makefile.\s-1PL\s0.
\fIThanks to Andreas Koenig for the much-needed kick in the pants...\fR
.Sp
Added t/*.t files for testing.  Eeeeeeeeeeeh...it's a start.
.Sp
Fixed bug in default parsing routine for generating
output paths; it was warning about evil filenames if
there simply \fIwere\fR no recommended filenames.  D'oh!
.Sp
Fixed redefined \fIparts()\fR method in Entity.
.Sp
Fixed bugs in Head where field name wasn't being case folded.
.Ip "Version 1.10   " 4
A typo was causing the epilogue of an inner multipart
message to be swallowed to the end of the \s-1OUTER\s0 multipart
message; this has now been fixed.
\fIThanks to Igor Starovoitov for reporting this bug.\fR
.Sp
A bad regexp for parameter names was causing
some parameters to be parsed incorrectly; this has also
been fixed.
\fIThanks again to Igor Starovoitov for reporting this bug.\fR
.Sp
It is now possible to get full control of the filenaming
algorithm before output files are generated, and the default
algorithm is safer.
\fIThanks to Laurent Amon for pointing out the problems, and suggesting
some solutions.\fR
.Sp
Fixed illegal \*(L"simple\*(R" multipart test file.  D'\s-1OH\s0!
